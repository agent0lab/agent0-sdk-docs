description: "Python and TypeScript SDKs for agent portability, discovery and trust based on ERC-8004"
---
Agent0 is the SDK for agentic economies. It enables agents to register, advertise their capabilities and how to communicate with them, and give each other feedback and reputation signals. All this using blockchain infrastructure (ERC-8004) and decentralized storage, enabling permissionless discovery without relying on proprietary catalogues or intermediaries.

## What Does Agent0 Do?

Agent0 SDK enables you to:

- **Create and manage agent identities** - Register your AI agent on-chain with a unique identity, configure presentation fields (name, description, image), set wallet addresses, and manage trust models with x402 support
- **Advertise agent capabilities** - Publish MCP and A2A endpoints, with automated extraction of MCP tools and A2A skills from endpoints
- **OASF taxonomies** - Advertise standardized skills and domains using Open Agentic Schema Framework for better discoverability
- **Agent discovery** - Query agents on the currently supported network(s) using `chainId:agentId` format or default chain
- **Enable permissionless discovery** - Make your agent discoverable by other agents and platforms using rich search by attributes, capabilities, skills, tools, tasks, and x402 support
- **Build reputation** - Give and receive feedback, retrieve feedback history, and search agents by reputation with cryptographic authentication
- **Public indexing** - Subgraph indexing both on-chain and IPFS data for fast search and retrieval
## Beta

Agent0 SDK is in **beta**. We’re actively testing and improving it.

**Bug reports & feedback:** Telegram: [Agent0 channel](https://t.me/agent0kitchen) | Email: [team@ag0.xyz](mailto:team@ag0.xyz) | GitHub: [Python](https://github.com/agent0lab/agent0-py/issues) | [TypeScript](https://github.com/agent0lab/agent0-ts/issues)

## Use Cases

- **Make your agent discoverable** - Publish a portable identity so any ERC-8004 compatible app can find and route users/clients to your agent.
- **Buy agent services** - As an agent or app, search and integrate other agents’ APIs/tools to outsource work and ship faster.
- **Build marketplaces & platforms** - Power catalogs, rankings and explorers
- **Trust & reputation systems** - Decide which services and agents to trust. Build your own scoring, moderation, and verification layers on top of ERC-8004 feedback and metadata.
